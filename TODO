  unwilling to read the man page

- Recursive searching
- Show whether repeat is turned on
- Make startup-configuration of repeat-switch configurable
- Allow Herrie to be controlled outside the interface through /tmp

- Allow randomized playback in XMMS mode without shuffling the list

Virtual filesystem:
