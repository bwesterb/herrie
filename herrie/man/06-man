.TP
.B vfs.cache=no
Cache file system entries to reduce disk I/O. This option massively
improves search performance on large directories. It is disabled by
default, since it increases memory footprint and requires you to press
.B P
to purge the cache manually, in case files are created and deleted in
the background. The purging of the cache may cause memory leaks, since
the caching could introduce cyclic dependencies.
.TP
.B vfs.dir.hide_dotfiles=yes
Hide files in directories with a filename starting with a dot.
.TP
.B vfs.lockup.chroot=
Lock the application's filebrowser in a directory. Please note that
.B herrie
must be launched as
.I root
for this switch to work. It is advised to set
.B vfs.lockup.user
as well.
.TP
.B vfs.lockup.user=
Change the effective user of the application to the specified user.
